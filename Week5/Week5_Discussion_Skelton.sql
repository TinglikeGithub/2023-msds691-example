-- Example 3. Revenue Over Time
-- https://platform.stratascratch.com/coding/10314-revenue-over-time
-- Find the 3-month rolling average of total revenue from purchases 
-- given a table with users, their purchase amount, and date purchased. 
---- Do not include returns which are represented by negative purchase values. 
---- Output the year-month (YYYY-MM) and 3-month rolling average of revenue, 
---- sorted from earliest month to latest month. 
---- A 3-month rolling average is defined by calculating the average total revenue 
---- from all user purchases for the current month and previous two months. 
---- The first two months will not be a true 3-month rolling average 
---- since we are not given data from last year. 
---- Assume each month has at least one purchase.

-- Example 4. Monthly Percentage Difference
-- https://platform.stratascratch.com/coding/10319-monthly-percentage-difference
-- Given a table of purchases by date, 
-- calculate the month-over-month percentage change in revenue. 
-- The output should include the year-month date (YYYY-MM) and percentage change, 
-- rounded to the 2nd decimal point, and sorted 
-- from the beginning of the year to the end of the year.
-- The percentage change column will be populated from the 2nd month 
-- forward and can be calculated as 
-- ((this month's revenue - last month's revenue) / last month's revenue)*100.
