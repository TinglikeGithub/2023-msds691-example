-- Ex 2. Meta/Facebook is developing a search algorithm that will allow users to search through their post history. You have been assigned to evaluate the performance of this algorithm.
-- We have a table with the user's search term, search result positions, and whether or not the user clicked on the search result.
-- Write a query that assigns ratings to the searches in the following way:
---- If the search was not clicked for any term, assign the search with rating=1
---- If the search was clicked but the top position of clicked terms was outside the top 3 positions, assign the search a rating=2
---- If the search was clicked and the top position of a clicked term was in the top 3 positions, assign the search a rating=3
-- As a search ID can contain more than one search term, select the highest rating for that search ID. Output the search ID and its highest rating.

-- Ex 4. Identify projects that are at risk for going overbudget. A project is considered to be overbudget if the cost of all employees assigned to the project is greater than the budget of the project.
---- You'll need to prorate the cost of the employees to the duration of the project. For example, if the budget for a project that takes half a year to complete is $10K, then the total half-year salary of all employees assigned to the project should not exceed $10K. Salary is defined on a yearly basis, so be careful how to calculate salaries for the projects that last less or more than one year.
---- Output a list of projects that are overbudget with their project name, project budget, and prorated total employee expense (rounded to the next dollar amount).
---- HINT: to make it simpler, consider that all years have 365 days. You don't need to think about the leap years.
